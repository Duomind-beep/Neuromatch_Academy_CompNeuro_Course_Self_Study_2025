## Overview
This day introduces you to some of the applications of deep learning in neuroscience. 
In the three tutorials, we apply deep learning principles in three key ways they are used in neuroscience: decoding models, encoding models, and representational similarity analysis.
In each of the tutorials, we use the same neural activity, which was recorded from the visual cortex of awake mice while the mice were presented with oriented grating stimuli. 
- In Tutorial 1, we start with even simpler neural networks consisting of fully connected linear layers. We introduce non-linear activation functions and how to optimize these deep networks using PyTorch and back-propagation. We optimize the network to decode the presented visual stimulus from the recorded neural activity in the visual cortex.
   
- Next, Tutorial 2 introduces convolutional layers, the building blocks of networks for visual tasks. The bonus in that tutorial is to fit an encoding model from visual stimuli to neural activity.
- Finally, in Tutorial 3, we optimize a convolutional neural network to perform an orientation discrimination task and compare the internal representations of the artificial neural networks to neural activity using a representational similarity analysis technique.
