# Tutorial Objectives
*Estimated timing of tutorial: 1 hour, 25 minutes*

During today, we will learn the basics of linear algebra, focusing on the topics that underlie the material on future days in the NMA Computational Neuroscience course. In this tutorial, we focus on vectors: their definition, their properties & operations, and how we can use them to define our coordinate system.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:
* Be able to provide an example of how linear algebra is used in computational neuroscience
* Be able to describe vectors, their properties (dimensionality/length), and their operations (scalar multiplication, vector addition, dot product) geometrically
* Be able to determine and explain the number of basis vectors necessary for a given vector space
