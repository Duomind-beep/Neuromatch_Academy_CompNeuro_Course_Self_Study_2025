## Tutorial objectives

We learned basic Python and NumPy concepts in the previous tutorial. These new and efficient coding techniques can be applied repeatedly in tutorials from the NMA course, and elsewhere.

In this tutorial, we'll introduce spikes in our LIF neuron and evaluate the refractory period's effect in spiking dynamics!
