# Objectives


Today, the focus will be on **linear dynamics**, where $f(x)$ is a linear function of $x$.

# Tutorial 1: Linear Dynamical Systems
* Explore and understand the behavior of such systems where $x$ is a single variable
* Consider cases where $\mathbf{x}$ is a state vector representing two variables.
