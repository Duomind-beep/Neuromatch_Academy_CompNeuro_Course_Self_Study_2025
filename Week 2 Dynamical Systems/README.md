**Dynamical Systems**. In this module, you will learn all about dynamical systems and
how to apply them to build more biologically plausible models of neurons and networks of neurons. In *Linear Systems*,
you will cover a lot of the really foundational knowledge on dynamical systems that you will use throughout the rest of the course,
including a brief dive into stochastic systems which will underlie the next module.  During *Biological Neuron Models*,
you will start to use this knowledge to build models of individual neurons that are more rooted in biology. In *Dynamic Networks*,
 you will extend upon the previous day to start building and analyzing networks of neurons. We will often ask ‘how’ questions
 using these models: how are things in the brain happening mechanistically? These models are often not directly fit to data
 (in contrast to the machine learning models), but instead are built based on bottom up knowledge of the system.
