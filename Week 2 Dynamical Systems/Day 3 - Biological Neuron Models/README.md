## Overview

Lesson regarding the properties of biological neurons and synapses. These tutorials are about how neurons may generate irregular spike patterns and synchronize their activity.

* In the **first tutorial** you will learn about the input-output transfer function of the leaky integrate and fire neuron model.
* In the **second tutorial** you will use this model to understand how statistics of inputs affects transfer of synchrony.
* In the **third tutorial** you will explore the short-term dynamics of synapses which means that synaptic weight is dependent on the recent history of spiking activity of the pre-synaptic neurons.
* In the **bonus tutorial**, you can learn about spike timing dependent plasticity and explore how synchrony in the input may shape the synaptic weight distribution.
  
Neuron and synapse models are essential building blocks of mechanistic models of brain function and dysfunction. One of the common questions in neuroscience is to identify the causes of changes in the statistics of spiking activity patterns. Whether these changes are caused by changes in neuron/synapse properties or by a change in the input or by a combination of both? With the contents of this tutorial, you should have a framework to think about which changes in spike patterns are due to neuron/synapse or input changes.
